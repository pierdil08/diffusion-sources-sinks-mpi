# Diffusion with Sources and Sinks (SOR, MPI, C)

This project solves a 2D steady-state diffusion equation with internal sources and sinks using the Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) method. The simulation models heat distribution on a rectangular plate with insulated boundaries and two internal Dirac-type perturbations. Implemented in C and executed on Northwestern‚Äôs high-performance computing system using MPI parallelism.

## üî¨ Equation

The elliptic PDE solved is:

\[
\nabla^2 u = \frac{10\lambda}{\sqrt{\pi}} e^{-\lambda^2((x-1)^2+y^2)} - \frac{10\lambda}{\sqrt{\pi}} e^{-\lambda^2((x+1)^2+y^2)}
\]

Subject to boundary conditions:

\[
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}(\pm2, y) = 0, \quad u(x, \pm1) = 0
\]

where:
- `Œª` controls the width of the source/sink peaks
- The left and right boundaries are insulated
- The top and bottom are held at fixed temperature
